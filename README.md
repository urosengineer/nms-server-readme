# spring-boot-backend-portfolio

This codebase is curated and maintained by Uros, a backend engineer specializing in enterprise Java/Spring Boot solutions. It demonstrates best practices in modern backend architecture, API design, and production-quality engineering.

This repository demonstrates an extensible, production-grade backend platform tailored for newsrooms, broadcast, and automation use cases. It showcases how to architect, document, and secure a modern Java backend following best enterprise practices.

## Business Impact Summary

Designed for television newsrooms, the platform centralizes story planning, device control, and content generation to reduce on‚Äëair errors and accelerate production cycles. Integrated AI services help journalists craft titles, summaries, and social posts in seconds, while voice services automatically transcribe interviews and generate narration. Remote command modules streamline control of teleprompters, character generators, and video walls from one interface, cutting setup time during live shows. Built‚Äëin analytics and dashboards provide managers with real‚Äëtime visibility into broadcast activity and resource usage. Secure APIs and SSL encryption ensure sensitive editorial data is protected end‚Äëto‚Äëend. The modular architecture makes it easier for IT teams to extend the system with new devices or workflows.

## Database ER Diagram

Below is a complete Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram of the core database schema  
(click to enlarge for details). Both the PNG and PDF versions contain all tables and relationships.

## Database Schema Auto-Update

For demo and portfolio purposes, this project is configured with:

    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

This setting demonstrates how automatic database schema updates could be configured in a runnable application, allowing reviewers to understand the approach without manual migration steps.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Production Usage Warning**  
>
> - In any real production environment, database schema management **must** be handled via migration tools such as [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) or [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/).
> - The `ddl-auto` property should be set to `validate` (or `none`) to prevent accidental schema changes.
> - All credentials and secrets **must** be provided via secure mechanisms and **never committed to version control**.
>
> This configuration is **intentional**, to simplify code review and illustrate project architecture for demo purposes only.  
> **This public repository does not contain a complete, runnable application, and this configuration is provided for demonstration only.**  
> **Do not use this configuration in production.**
>
> _In the full production implementation, all database migrations are version-controlled, all secrets are managed securely, and schema changes are never performed automatically._

## Deployment Overview

1. **Build and run with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   This launches all services with sensible defaults for demonstration.
2. **Components started**
   | Service | Purpose |
   |---------|--------|
   | `nms-server` | Spring Boot backend serving APIs and WebSockets |
   | `mariadb` | Stores newsroom data such as stories, rundowns, and logs |
   | `redis` | Caches sessions and enforces rate limits for fast responses |
   | `prometheus` | Collects runtime metrics from the server |
   | `grafana` | Displays dashboards built from Prometheus metrics |

## Quick Start (Local Review Build)

This section explains how to run the **review/demo build** provided in the `nms-server-deploy-full.tar.gz` archive.  
It is intended for internal review and demonstration purposes only.

### 1. Extract the archive

```bash
tar -xvzf nms-server-deploy-full.tar.gz
cd nms-server-deploy
```

After extraction, the directory structure should look like:

```text
.env
.env.example
docker-compose.yml
Dockerfile
nms-server-demo-deploy-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
monitoring/
  prometheus.yml
```

### 2. Build and start containers

```bash
docker build -t nms-server:latest .
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Services and ports

### 4. Notes

- The `uploads_data` volume persists uploaded files across container restarts.  
- `.env` contains all environment variables ‚Äî adjust as needed before starting.  
- For production deployments, change `JWT_SECRET`, database credentials, and all `change_me` values.  

## Security & Access Control

- **JWT authentication with refresh tokens** secures API calls while allowing stateless scaling.
- **Role and permission system** restricts sensitive actions such as device control to authorized staff.
- **Email verification and password reset flows** ensure only verified users gain access.
- **SSL/TLS over HTTPS** encrypts all traffic end-to-end; a demo keystore is provided.
- **Configurable CORS and rate limiting** protect the API from cross-site abuse and request floods.

## Testing

Representative unit and integration tests (JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test) are provided in `src/test/java/`.  
These cover the main services and business logic relevant for newsroom automation and backend best practices.

## Monitoring & Observability

Prometheus and Grafana provide full visibility into the system:

- **Prometheus** scrapes metrics exposed by Spring Boot Actuator, capturing HTTP request counts/latency, database usage, WebSocket traffic, and JVM health.
- **Grafana dashboards** visualize memory consumption, CPU load, thread states, and custom newsroom metrics so operations teams can spot issues quickly.

Sample Grafana dashboard (JVM/Micrometer):

[![JVM Grafana Dashboard](docs/jvm_dashboard.png)](http://localhost:3000/d/517290dc-ae1b-4c72-9ea6-d9c70f44f6ca/jvm-micrometer?orgId=1&from=now-24h&to=now&refresh=30s)

> **Note:**
> Some panels display "No data" as this screenshot is from a development environment with limited workloads and integrations enabled.
> Full observability, alerting, and production monitoring scripts (including advanced metrics and alerting) are available in the private repository and upon request for qualified clients.
> **Business-oriented dashboards** (with high-level system and workflow health metrics for managers and end-users) can be provided or customized for client needs.
